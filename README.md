# segmentation-for-autonomous-driving
using pytorch to segment carla 3d image with unet 
# image-segmenter


The goal of this project is to create an image segmentation model with images extracted from CARLA similator.

I used a modified UNET architecture and  trained it in pytorch using images and segmentations generated from CARLA framework. (code included)

after evaluating the model I deployed my work on heroku and I'm currently still working on on the model API that segments the input images
